# ***Qis-Kit-Gurjot-Singh-Project***
learning about using Quantum processors through IBM cloud using the actual quantum computers and not simulation

## **Goals of Project**:
For my quantum computing class we have covered the key ideas behind quantum super position states and how these states can be represeted by bra-ket notation. This model is extremeely useful for solving on paper but what this entails

$$ |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |H\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |T\rangle $$
